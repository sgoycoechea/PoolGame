# Pool Game

This is a billiard game made with C++ and OpenGL. It was made as a two person project for the University course Introduction to Computer Graphics.

The code we developed is in the following files:
- main
- src/Ball
- src/Point
- src/Color
- src/Rotation

The code in the following files is from a 3D mesh model loader downloaded from the internet:

- src/assimp
- src/objloader


No physics engine was used for the project.
